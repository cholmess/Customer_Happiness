Summary of the project

A logistics and delivery startup wants to evaluate their customers satisfaction after facing multiple challenges in on-demand delivery during the pandemic.

A sample of surveys* are given by the customer with the following details:

Y = target attribute (Y) with values indicating 0 (unhappy) and 1 (happy) customers
X1 = my order was delivered on time
X2 = contents of my order was as I expected
X3 = I ordered everything I wanted to order
X4 = I paid a good price for my order
X5 = I am satisfied with my courier
X6 = the app makes ordering easy for me
Attributes X1 to X6 indicate the responses for each question and have values from 1 to 5 where the smaller number indicates less and the higher number indicates more towards the answer.

Conclusion
Company target of 73% can't be achieved with the small amount of data provided. Removing features will only decrease the score and do feature engineering can create multicollinearity.

Score will increase as we have more data available or more questions added. Model selection could change by then
